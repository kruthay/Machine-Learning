Please place the .ipynb file in the same folder as with other train and test  data files
My code uses numpy library and (scipy library (just for preprocessing data)), Please install it from https://numpy.org 
There is an output file with the predicted output from test data set. 
Data in the output file is seperated by new line. 
The program should run fairly fast, please reduce the ram usage in case of any issues.
Thanks
